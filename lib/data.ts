# Chapter 1: Introduction to Economics

## 1.1 What is Economics? in detail
Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about how to allocate resources. It generally deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.

At its core, economics determines how a society provides for its needs. Since resources are not infinite (a concept known as **scarcity**), we must make choices. Every choice involves a trade-off.

### The Two Main Branches
1. **Microeconomics**:
   - Focuses on the behavior of individual consumers and producers.
   - Analyzes how they make decisions (e.g., "Should I buy coffee or tea?").
   - Studies how individuals interact in specific markets.
   
2. **Macroeconomics**:
   - Studies the economy as a whole.
   - Looks at aggregate variables:
     - Total production (GDP)
     - Total employment (Unemployment rate)
     - General price level (Inflation)

## 1.2 Key Concepts defined

### Scarcity
The fundamental economic problem of having seemingly unlimited human wants in a world of limited resources. Because of scarcity, we cannot have everything we want, so we must make choices.

### Opportunity Cost
The cost of the next best alternative foregone when a choice is made.
- *Example*: If you spend an hour studying economics, the opportunity cost is the hour you could have spent watching a movie or sleeping.

### Supply and Demand
The relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy.
- **Law of Demand**: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases.
- **Law of Supply**: As price increases, quantity supplied increases.

## 1.3 Factors of Production
Resources used to produce goods and services:
1. **Land**: Natural resources (water, oil, trees).
2. **Labor**: Human effort (workers).
3. **Capital**: Man-made resources used in production (machines, factories).
4. **Entrepreneurship**: The skill of bringing the other factors together.

## 1.4 Exam Tips
> [!TIP]
> **Remember**: "There is no such thing as a free lunch." This famous quote illustrates *Opportunity Cost*.

- Be able to distinguish between **positive economics** (facts, "what is") and **normative economics** (opinions, "what ought to be").
- Graphing Supply & Demand is crucial. Practice drawing the "X" shape where they intersect at Equilibrium.
